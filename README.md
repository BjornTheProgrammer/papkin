# Papkin

A plugin for [PumpkinMC](https://pumpkinmc.org/) that adds support for [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) plugins.

## Installation

1. Install [java](https://docs.papermc.io/misc/java-install/)
2. Download the plugin in releases `papkin-mac.dylib`, `papkin-linux-aarch64.so`, `papkin-linux-x86.so`, or `papkin-windows-x86.dll`.
3. Add it into your PumpkinMC plugin directory (this gets created after runing PumpkinMC for the first time).
4. Run PumpkinMC again, and you should see a new directory in PumpkinMC called `papkin`. You can add any `bukkit`, `spigot`, or `paper` plugin you wish, and it will run.
