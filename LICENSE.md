Papkin Licensing Notice
======================

Papkin contains two distinct components with separate licensing:

1. Java Code (Directory: `/java`)
---------------------------------
The Java source code in this directory is a derivative work of the
PaperMC, Spigot, CraftBukkit, and Bukkit projects. As a result, all
files in this directory are licensed under the GNU General Public
License v3 (GPLv3), unless a specific file explicitly states
otherwise.

Contributors must agree that contributions within the `/java`
directory are GPLv3. Contributors may optionally provide additional
permissions (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0), but these are supplemental and
do not remove or replace the GPLv3 licensing requirements for
derivative works.

2. Rust Code (Directory: `/rust`)
---------------------------------
All Rust source code and supporting files outside the `/java`
directory are **not derived from GPLv3 software** and are licensed
under a dual MIT + Apache License. Contributors agree that their
contributions in this area will be dual-licensed accordingly.

- You retain full copyright ownership over your contributions.
- You grant Papkin the right to distribute your work according to the
  applicable directory license.
